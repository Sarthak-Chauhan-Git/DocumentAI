# DocuChat: Conversational Q&A with Your Documents

![Project Banner/GIF](link_to_your_demo_image_or_gif.gif)
*<p align="center">A brief demo showing document upload and Q&A interaction.</p>*

An intuitive web application that allows users to upload documents and ask questions about their content. Stop skimming through pages of text and get the information you need instantly. This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate, context-aware answers based solely on the provided document.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Multi-Format Support:** Upload documents in various formats like `$PDF$`, `$DOCX$`, and `$TXT$`.
-   **Natural Language Queries:** Ask questions just like you would to a person.
-   **Context-Aware Answers:** The model's responses are strictly based on the content of your uploaded document, preventing hallucinations.
-   **Source Highlighting (Optional Feature):** Pinpoints the exact text chunks from the document that were used to generate the answer.
-   **Simple & Clean UI:** An easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit/Flask/React.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This project is built on the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture.

1.  **Document Ingestion:** The uploaded document is loaded and its text is extracted.
2.  **Text Chunking:** The extracted text is split into smaller, manageable chunks.
3.  **Embedding:** Each chunk is converted into a numerical representation (vector embedding) using a sentence-transformer model.
4.  **Vector Storage:** These embeddings are stored in a `FAISS` / `ChromaDB` vector store for efficient searching.
5.  **Q&A Process:**
    -   When you ask a question, it is also converted into an embedding.
    -   The system performs a similarity search in the vector store to find the most relevant text chunks from the document.
    -   These relevant chunks (the "context") are passed along with your question to a Large Language Model (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT).
    -   The LLM generates a final, human-readable answer based on the provided context.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Python (`Flask` / `FastAPI`)
-   **Frontend:** `Streamlit` / `React`
-   **LLM Orchestration:** `LangChain` / `LlamaIndex`
-   **LLM:** Google `Gemini` / `OpenAI GPT-4` / Hugging Face `Llama2`
-   **Embeddings:** `Sentence-Transformers` / `OpenAI Embeddings`
-   **Vector Store:** `FAISS` (local) / `ChromaDB`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9+
-   An API key from OpenAI / Google AI Studio.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
    # or
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## üìà Future Improvements

-   [ ] Support for chatting with multiple documents simultaneously.
-   [ ] Add user authentication and conversation history.
-   [ ] Support for image-based documents (`JPG`, `PNG`) using OCR.
-   [ ] Dockerize the application for easy deployment.
